    "In Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar, the modulation pattern for changing frequencies is often implemented using either a **sawtooth** or **triangular** waveform. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Principle of Operation**:\n",
    "   - FMCW radar continuously sends out a signal with a slowly changing frequency over time.\n",
    "   - When this signal encounters a target, it reflects back toward the radar system.\n",
    "   - The frequency of the reflected signal changes based on the target's distance and velocity.\n",
    "   - By analyzing the time delay between transmission and reception, we can determine the target's range.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Characteristics of FMCW Radar**:\n",
    "   - FMCW radar systems often use a **sawtooth** pattern for frequency modulation. This pattern is crucial for accurate range and speed measurements, especially in applications like automotive radar¹.\n",
    "   - The Doppler effect causes additional frequency shifting of the echo signal due to the target's motion. The relationship for the received frequency shift (\\(f_{Rx}\\)) due to Doppler effect is given by:\n",
    "     $ f_{Rx} = f_{Tx} \\left(1 + \\frac{v}{c}\\right) \\left(1 - \\frac{v}{c}\\right) $\n",
    "     where:\n",
    "     - $f_{Rx}$ is the received frequency.\n",
    "     - $f_{Tx}$ is the transmitted frequency.\n",
    "     - \\(v\\) is the target's velocity.\n",
    "     - \\(c\\) is the speed of light².\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Range Resolution**:\n",
    "   - The range resolution of FMCW radar depends on the bandwidth of the transmitted FMCW signal.\n",
    "   - The smaller the frequency intervals covered by the signal, the better the resolution.\n",
    "   - The range resolution ($\\Delta R$) is inversely proportional to the bandwidth (\\(B_w\\)) of the transmitted signal:\n",
    "     $ \\Delta R \\propto \\frac{1}{B_w} $\n",
    "     Larger bandwidths lead to finer resolution⁵.\n",
